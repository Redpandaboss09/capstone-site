            <b>Real World Connection #1</b>: Calculus in Engineering <br>
            Understanding derivatives in calculus is crucial for engineers in various fields such as aerospace,
            mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering. Engineers use derivatives to analyze the rate of change
            of quantities like velocity, acceleration, and temperature over time. For example, when designing a roller
            coaster, engineers use calculus to calculate the optimal angles and curves for the ride to ensure a
            thrilling yet safe experience for riders. <br>

            <b>Real World Connection #2</b>: Calculus in Economics <br>
            In the world of finance and economics, derivatives play a significant role. Economists and financial
            analysts utilize calculus to analyze functions that represent economic data, such as revenue, profit,
            and cost functions. By finding derivatives, they can determine critical points where revenue is maximized
            or cost is minimized, helping businesses make strategic decisions to maximize their profits. <br>
