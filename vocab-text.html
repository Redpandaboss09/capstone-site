            Poetry is a form of literature that expresses emotions and ideas in a rhythmic and often lyrical way.
            The sublime beauty of nature is often a common theme in poetry, with poets using words to evoke powerful
            emotions in their readers. An apostrophe is a poetic device where the speaker addresses a person or
            object directly, even if they are not present. Some poems, like ballads, tell a story in a simple and
            rhythmic way, often focusing on themes of love or tragedy. On the other hand, a sonnet is a specific
            form of poetry with 14 lines, usually exploring themes of love, beauty, or the passage of time. Studying
            poetry can help us appreciate language in a new light and understand the depth of human emotions through
            words.
